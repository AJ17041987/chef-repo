resources are the fundamental building blocks of chef configuration.

resources are gathered into recipes

recipes ensure that the system are in desired tate

recipes are configuration files that describe resources and their desired state.

So recipes can 
       install and configure software components
	   manage files
	   deploy applications
	   execute other recipes and so on.
	   
	   
A recipe can be used configure multiple resources.
           
		   example:
		          package "apache2"
				  
				  template "/etc/apach2/apach2.conf" do
				        source "apache2.conf.erb"
						owner "root"
                        group "root"
                        mode  "0644"
                        variables(:allow_override => "all")
                        notifies :reload, ":service[apache2]"
                  end

                  service "apache2" do
                      action[:enable,:start]
                      supports :reload => true
				  end

here service , package and template are resources which need to be configured .
