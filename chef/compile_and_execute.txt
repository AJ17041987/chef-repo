when a chef client runs and encounters a recipe what it does is it compiles the recipe and then executes it.

compile phase
           chef cliet will load all of the cookbooks from the runlist.
		   it will read each recipe.
		   after reading each recipe it will build a resource collection.
		   
		   for ex. resource collection=[package["apache2"],service["apache2"],cookbook_file["/var/www/index.html"]
		   



execution phase
               the resource collection will be passed to execution phase.
       		   for ex. resource collection=[package["apache2"],service["apache2"],cookbook_file["/var/www/index.html"]
			   
			   it will take all the resources and ask appropriate questions about the resources like
			   
			   package["apache2"] is the resource in the appropriate state.
			    if yes then chef client will do nothing.
				if no then chef client will take action to bring the resource in line with the desired state.
				
			after bringing the first resource in resource in the desired state chef client will move onto next resource in 
            the resource collection.
