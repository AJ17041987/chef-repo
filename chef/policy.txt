in chef we define policies for each resource in our chef configuration.

using these policies we make sure that resources are in desired state but we don't have to tell chef client how to get 
a resource in a desired state the chef client is smart enough to figure that out .

policies are stored on chef server which chef client pulls out and applies it on a node.

policies are different for different resources.

A resource in chef represents a piece of a system and its desired state.
    for example. A resource can be a package that should be installed. here package is a piece of a system and installed is its desired state.
	same way a service that should be running . here service is a piece of a system and its desired state is that it should be running.
	same way a file that should be managed.
	a cron job that should be running.
	a user that should be managed.
	and so on.
