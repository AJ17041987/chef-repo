when a chef client runs it builds the node i.e. it builds the node object i.e. data attributes about the node on which chef client is running.

ohai is the utility which provides all the system level data.

After building the node chef client will then authenticate with the chef server.

after authenticating with chef server chef client enquires with the chef server what is its run lists look like.
then the chef server will sync the cookbooks.

if nothing has changed in the runlist i.e. there is no change in the cookbooks then chef client will download nothing.
it will only sync the cookbooks if something has chamged.

after that the chef client will load the cookbooks in memory.

after loading the cookbooks into memory the chef client will run through all the recipes and bring the node inline with the policy.
if the node is already inline with the resources defined in the recipes .chef will do nothing.

if any of the steps fail chef client will exit.

and if all the steps are success chef client will  do node.save i.e. it will share all the latest information about the chef client node
back with the chef server.

the last thing is running custom modules like notification handlers whose use cases include.
      sending email about successful chef run.
	  sending email about chef client run failure.
	  monitoring chef client run time etc.
