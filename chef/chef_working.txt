a chef client installed on a node runs regularly on the node and checks the state of the resource on the node.

a chef client regularly pulls policies from the chef server i.e. the policies it should follow.

policies are stored on the chef server and include
                                                 environments,roles ,cookbooks ,data bags etc.
												 
cookbooks contain recipes and attributes.

the joining of a node with a set of policies is called a run list.

the job of chef client is to download the run list and look for the recipes and enforce the policies on that server.

the run list is a collection of policies that a node should follow.

chef client obtains the the run list from the chef server.

chef client ensures the node complies with the policy in the run list.
