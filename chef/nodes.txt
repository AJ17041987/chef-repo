so this is how it looks till now 
                                organization (Mindtree)
	                                environment(staging,test,development,production etc)
			                             roles(database server,application server,load balancing server etc.)
					                           nodes(computer or server nodes)
											   
											   
nodes can be pysical hardware or virtual instance or a cloud instance.

each node
     belongs to one organization
	 belongs to one environment
	 a node can have zero or more roles i.e. it can either be a database server or an application server or more or can have zero roles
	                            in an environment.
								
								
to make each node ahere to a policy or a number of policies chef client runs on each node
         chef client gathers the current configuration of a system
		 compares the current configuration with the desired configuration
		 and if the node is not in the desired state chef client makes sure node adheres to a policy and goes back to desired state.
		 


chef client running on your node makes sure that your node adheres to a particular policy.

policies are nothing but list of configuration items on your run list.

a run list is what a chef client uses to bring a node to a desired state.
