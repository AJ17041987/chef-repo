with chef server we have a number of private keys.

chef server requires these keys to authenticate.

we have 
   client.pem which is the private key for API client.
   
   validation.pem which is the private key for ORGNAME validator.
   
first thing in the validation process is that chef client will look into /etc/chef on the linux box to find if client.pem exists.

[ajitesh@localhost ~]$ cd /etc/chef/
[ajitesh@localhost chef]$ ls
client.pem  client.rb  first-boot.json


if the client.pem exists on the server where chef client is installed .chef client will use this client.pem to authenticate itself 
with the chef server.

however if that file doesn't exist it will look for file /etc/chef/validation.pem.

if both client.pem and alidation.pem is not found chef server will return 401 not found.

if validation.pem is found then the chef client will use the validation.pem to request an api client.

the chef server in response will generate the client.pem and send it back to chef client.

after getting the client.pem chef client will sign in with the chef server.

so validation.pem is only required if we don't have client.pem.
