a node is any physical ,virtual or cloud machines that is configured to be maintained by a chef.

when you are writing recipes ,the node object is always available to you.

[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$ knife node list
target1
[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$


[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$ knife client list
cm_s-validator
target1
[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$


each node in your organization should have a unique name.

chef defaults to the fully qualified domain name of the server i.e. in the format server.domain.com .

we overrode it to target1 to make it easier.

to see node details.use below command.

[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$ knife node show target1
Node Name:   target1
Environment: _default
FQDN:        localhost
IP:          192.168.209.137

[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$

nodes are made up of attributes
  any of the attributes are discovered automatically(attributes like ip,platform, address ,number of cpus etc.)
  many other objects in chef can also add node attributes (cookbooks ,roles and environments ,recipes ,attribute files)
  
  
nodes are stored and indexed on the chef server.

to display all the information about node attributes in chef use.

sudo ohai |less

to display this chef node information on chef workstation use

knife node show target1 -l

[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$ knife node show target1 -Fj
{
  "name": "target1",
  "chef_environment": "_default",
  "run_list": [
  "recipe[yum]",
  "recipe[apache]"
]
,
  "normal": {
    "tags": [

    ]
  }
}


we can also view single attribute about the node.

[ajitesh@localhost chef-repo]$ knife node show target1 -a fqdn
target1:
  fqdn: localhost
